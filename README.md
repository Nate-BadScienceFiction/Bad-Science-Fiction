# Bad-Science-Fiction

## Science Fiction Analysis and Software Engineering with a Generative AI Collaborateur.

### What is Bad Science Fiction?
BSF, or Bad Science Fiction, describes a collaborative software project on GitHub. As explained in the AI Advances articles, the project is so named because its ostensible goal is to develop a text analysis tool specializing in science fictionâ€”a tool developed in collaboration with Generative AI. However, it is as much an experiment on how best to leverage large language models (LLMs) to enhance software development.
